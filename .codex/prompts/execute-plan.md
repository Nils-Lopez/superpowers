# Superpowers: execute-plan

Execute the approved plan in small batches with built-in reviews using the **executing-plans** skill.

- Current batch or focus: $ARGUMENTS
- Run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill superpowers:executing-plans`
- Follow the skill: apply tasks in order, use two-stage review (spec compliance → code quality), and keep changes reversible.

Deliver after each batch:
- What changed (files, diffs, tests)
- Review findings and fixes
- Next batch to run
